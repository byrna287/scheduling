This is the repo for the C starter files.  Read the details below carefully. Only implement the files for the project-type you are undertaking.

Completing this project will require writing the following C (or python) files

schedule_fcfs.c
schedule_sjf.c
schedule_rr.c
schedule_priority.c
schedule_priority_rr.c

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

For example, to build the FCFS scheduler, enter
```
make fcfs
```
which builds the fcfs executable file.
